Notes on Wesleyan course on Modernity and Postmodernity via coursera by Michael S. Roth. Full course available here: [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-postmodern-1 ]]

The course is more or less structured along key figures (not unlike Barzun's dawn to decadence). The following is only a reminder of key ideas, salient points for each.

# Enlightment

## Kant

We start in Sep 30 of 1784 with Kant's "What is enlightment" (http://www.artoftheory.com/what-is-enlightenment_immanuel-kant/). The project of the enlightenment is one of liberation from self-imposed immaturity *through reason*. It is also a process with a dimension of social revolution as the role of the shepperds, particularly religious ones can be dispensed with, once men guided by reason can discern what's right by themselves. *Sapere Aude!* Dare to know is the motto of the enlightenment.

It's important to emphasize that Kant was trying to drive a middle road between the _rationalism_ of Descartes ("I think therefore I am" as assertion of reliance on pure reason as only base) an English _empiricism_ of Locke and Hume who could be summarized as "I feel therefore I am" (sic). They kept skepticism at bay by piling up experience. I the case of Hume the assertion is weaker saying experience builds habit not true knowledge.  

## Rousseau

Kant intensely interested in Rousseau. Rousseau is the bad conscience of the enlightment. He rebels against the optimism of the enlightment itself preferring the idea of the _State of Nature_ and the _Natural man_.

The arts and sciences cover up oppression because they create new needs. What yoke could be imposed on man who need nothing?

The trap of the enlightment is this : elightment → luxury → inequality → yoke

It's not that he doesn't want people to learn. It is pointing out that the project of the enlightment is promoting the key ingredient of the slippery slope of enlightment: inequality.

His solution is mainly to bring the most enlightened to power. That said, in truth his contribution is mostly the diagnosis.

As you acquire luxuries you become more vulnerable to pain. In the society where you act for others and in immitation of higher ones, men suffer for the loss of something they have no pleasure in possesing.

In the discourse of the creation of inequality between mankind he discusses how the state becomes the guarantor of the state of inequality. The rich benefit from getting the poor to defend property.

elightment → luxury → inequality → yoke. Also self-imposed and self-demanded yoke as investment in feelings towards posessions tie us to them

The savage lives in himself; sociable man lives outside himself, capable of living only in the opinion of others and so to speak, derives the sentiment of his own existence solely from their judgement.

"It is manifestly against the law of nature, however that a child command an old man, an imbecile a wise man, and a handful of people about in superfluities while the starving multitude lacks in necessities"

It is important to note Rousseau never used the term "noble savage," in his discourse on inequality or anywhere else. It is a common persistent error to equate rousseau's views with primitivism. The whole "all fours" interpretation is famous starting with Voltaire but wrong.  Roberspierre also has his own interpretation which turns into the reign of terror in the french revolution: "lets create the commonality by killing the aristocracy". He clearly inspires strong reactions.

### Roberspierre and other responses

Voltaire mocks it (and perhaps starts the noble savage misunderstanding), Roberspierre and the radicals of the jacobins take Rousseau as a banner and read it as a banner for equality. Torqueville is connected in the sense that he underlined the tension between freedom and equality.


# Englightment to revolution

## Hegel

Main point here is a mid point (chronologically and philosophically) between rousseau and Marx.

Some students of Kant reject the division between the Phenomenal and Noumenal (knowable things like bridges and not such as freedom or immortality of the soul). One of them is Hegel.

Hegel's main tool is History. He believes that reason being supreme history is a reasonable process.

The classic hegelian _dialectic_ of Thesis | Antithesis → Synthesis is the main tactic. The | sign here stands for negation or conflict, what in german Hegel called aufhebung. e.g. Chaplin | Groucho → Woody Allen.

*"History is reasonable"* and through the conflict of opposites we arrive at a conclusion: Medieval Commune feudalism  | Individualistic Capitalism → moderated capitalism.

## Marx

State of nature and inequality as a source of corruption are ideas that resonate from Roussaeu.

Key point to Marx, deriving from Hegel is the history of class struggle. The main symptom is _alienation_, the more people produce the more it empoverish them.

Estranged labor of industrialism generates weath for the few and alienation for the many.

The result is the famous line that captures alienation of estranged labor: "what is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal." 

Tearing apart our species life. In early Marx the basic reality of humans is labor reflecting who we are (able to see ourselves in our labor) and the conditions of industrialization are in contradiction to it. This thesis and anthisesis *ha* to be resolved in the hegelian way and revolution has to happen.

From *alienation* to *emancipation*.

For Marx the working class is the vehicle to resolving the contradiction.aufhenbung. 

## Communist Manifesto 1847

"A spectre is haunting Europe..."

Communist Manifesto: { french radicalism, german hegelian theory, english theory of labor }

People doing the work: the middle class. Not the laborers. That might be surprising. The burgoeoisie has stripped of its halo.

It's all about class conflict. "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles"

*In 1847 Marx really real is class struggle.*

Alienation and economic exploitation is revealed by the burgeouisie.

In a way this has a parallel with civil rights and queer movement in the assumption that there is a hinge which once unraveled will collapse the edifice.

*1848-52 Revolutions break.* Right after the manifesto (not really because it, but still)

But the revolutions don't really go the way he expected. Great disillusion ensues. 

1848 France has a Bourgeois king Louis Phillipe who flees to england. The interests of the different revolutionaries are rendered clearly incongrous. Some want more land, other better jobs, and all in all it seems like people want more money.

The revolutionaries of 1848 are like the jews of Moses, Marx says. It not only has to conquer the wilderness but go under to make way. February all together, June slaughter. June real shows the middle class in opposition to the workers.

*February 1848* was the beautiful because the real conflicts were dormant 
*June days of 1848* are the ugly and real.

The bourgeoisie realizes they don't really want the laborers to share on the property... things turn violent between previous "allies":
Marx says "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity" really means "infantry, cavalry, artillery" - we will turn our power on former allies for money.

*After the 1852 dissilussion his really real is not class struggle but look at the economic laws beneath the class struggle. The project of capital begins.*
