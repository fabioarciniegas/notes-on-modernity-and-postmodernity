The course is more or less structured along key figures (not unlike Barzun's dawn to decadence). The following is meant as a reminder of the key ponts.

# Enlightment (week 1)

## Kant

We start in Sep 30 of 1784 with Kant's "What is enlightment" (http://www.artoftheory.com/what-is-enlightenment_immanuel-kant/). The project of the enlightenment is one of liberation from self-imposed immaturity *through reason*. It is also a process with a dimension of social revolution as the role of the shepperds, particularly religious ones can be dispensed with, once men guided by reason can discern what's right by themselves. *Sapere Aude!* Dare to know is the motto of the enlightenment.

It's important to emphasize that Kant was trying to drive a middle road between the _rationalism_ of Descartes ("I think therefore I am" as assertion of reliance on pure reason as only base) an English _empiricism_ of Locke and Hume who could be summarized as "I feel therefore I am" (sic). They kept skepticism at bay by piling up experience. I the case of Hume the assertion is weaker saying experience builds habit not true knowledge.  

## Rousseau

Kant intensely interested in Rousseau. Rousseau is the bad conscience of the enlightment. He rebels against the optimism of the enlightment itself preferring the idea of the _State of Nature_ and the _Natural man_.

The arts and sciences cover up oppression because they create new needs. What yoke could be imposed on man who need nothing?

The trap of the enlightment is this : elightment → luxury → inequality → yoke

It's not that he doesn't want people to learn. It is pointing out that the project of the enlightment is promoting the key ingredient of the slippery slope of enlightment: inequality.

His solution is mainly to bring the most enlightened to power. That said, in truth his contribution is mostly the diagnosis.

As you acquire luxuries you become more vulnerable to pain. In the society where you act for others and in immitation of higher ones, men suffer for the loss of something they have no pleasure in possesing.

In the discourse of the creation of inequality between mankind he discusses how the state becomes the guarantor of the state of inequality. The rich benefit from getting the poor to defend property.

elightment → luxury → inequality → yoke. Also self-imposed and self-demanded yoke as investment in feelings towards posessions tie us to them

The savage lives in himself; sociable man lives outside himself, capable of living only in the opinion of others and so to speak, derives the sentiment of his own existence solely from their judgement.

"It is manifestly against the law of nature, however that a child command an old man, an imbecile a wise man, and a handful of people about in superfluities while the starving multitude lacks in necessities"

It is important to note Rousseau never used the term "noble savage," in his discourse on inequality or anywhere else. It is a common persistent error to equate rousseau's views with primitivism. The whole "all fours" interpretation is famous starting with Voltaire but wrong.  Roberspierre also has his own interpretation which turns into the reign of terror in the french revolution: "lets create the commonality by killing the aristocracy". He clearly inspires strong reactions.

### Roberspierre and other responses

Voltaire mocks it (and perhaps starts the noble savage misunderstanding), Roberspierre and the radicals of the jacobins take Rousseau as a banner and read it as a banner for equality. Torqueville is connected in the sense that he underlined the tension between freedom and equality.


# Englightment to revolution (week 2)

## Hegel

Main point here is a mid point (chronologically and philosophically) between rousseau and Marx.

Some students of Kant reject the division between the Phenomenal and Noumenal (knowable things like bridges and not such as freedom or immortality of the soul). One of them is Hegel.

Hegel's main tool is History. He believes that reason being supreme history is a reasonable process.

The classic hegelian _dialectic_ of Thesis | Antithesis → Synthesis is the main tactic. The | sign here stands for negation or conflict, what in german Hegel called aufhebung. e.g. Chaplin | Groucho → Woody Allen.

*"History is reasonable"* and through the conflict of opposites we arrive at a conclusion: Medieval Commune feudalism  | Individualistic Capitalism → moderated capitalism.

## Marx

State of nature and inequality as a source of corruption are ideas that resonate from Roussaeu.

Key point to Marx, deriving from Hegel is the history of class struggle. The main symptom is _alienation_, the more people produce the more it empoverish them.

Estranged labor of industrialism generates weath for the few and alienation for the many.

The result is the famous line that captures alienation of estranged labor: "what is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal." 

Tearing apart our species life. In early Marx the basic reality of humans is labor reflecting who we are (able to see ourselves in our labor) and the conditions of industrialization are in contradiction to it. This thesis and anthisesis *ha* to be resolved in the hegelian way and revolution has to happen.

From *alienation* to *emancipation*.

For Marx the working class is the vehicle to resolving the contradiction.aufhenbung. 

## Communist Manifesto 1847

"A spectre is haunting Europe..."

Communist Manifesto: { french radicalism, german hegelian theory, english theory of labor }

People doing the work: the middle class. Not the laborers. That might be surprising. The burgoeoisie has stripped of its halo.

It's all about class conflict. "the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles"

*In 1847 Marx really real is class struggle.*

Alienation and economic exploitation is revealed by the burgeouisie.

In a way this has a parallel with civil rights and queer movement in the assumption that there is a hinge which once unraveled will collapse the edifice.

*1848-52 Revolutions break.* Right after the manifesto (not really because it, but still)

But the revolutions don't really go the way he expected. Great disillusion ensues. 

1848 France has a Bourgeois king Louis Phillipe who flees to england. The interests of the different revolutionaries are rendered clearly incongrous. Some want more land, other better jobs, and all in all it seems like people want more money.

The revolutionaries of 1848 are like the jews of Moses, Marx says. It not only has to conquer the wilderness but go under to make way. February all together, June slaughter. June real shows the middle class in opposition to the workers.

*February 1848* was the beautiful because the real conflicts were dormant 
*June days of 1848* are the ugly and real.

The bourgeoisie realizes they don't really want the laborers to share on the property... things turn violent between previous "allies":
Marx says "Liberty, Equality and Fraternity" really means "infantry, cavalry, artillery" - we will turn our power on former allies for money.

*After the 1852 dissilussion his really real is not class struggle but look at the economic laws beneath the class struggle. The project of capital begins.*

# Modernism and Art for Art's sake (week 3)

## Flaubert (1821-1880)

The dissilussion after the revolution hits not just Marx. People like Flaubert also dissilussioned answer: retreat to art.

If you have the capacity and talent leave the politics and business to lesser men, and do art. That's the "really real" for Flaubert. But that doesn't mean Flaubert is a romantic in the sense of indulging on emotion. In fact Madame Bovary is an indictment of that drunkenness of romantic cliche and banality and its consequences as its images can never be satisfied.

When people think they are going beyond the commonplace they do so with the most common vehicles. The cliche is the sign of stupidity. 

Romantics value authenticity, expression of the soul, color, emotion, turbulence. Flaubert knows it perfectly but can tell where it leads (Mdme Bovary sort of creatures) so he rejects it and makes cautionary tales about it. In short:

Flaubert is to romanticism what Roussau is to enlightment. 

## Utilitarianism and Romanticism

The roots of the utilitarian aspect of english enlightment goes back to Locke and the consent of the governed. A measure of freedom is sacrificed for security. The social contract.

Jeremy Bentham, the proper father of utilitarianism (1748-1842) wants to get to a calculus of benefit and pleasure that makes sense rationally. He claims "Antiquity is no reason"  meaning the argument against something like torture needs to be logical and based on the consideration of long run consequences rather than based on an underlying moral superstition or precedent.

The "calculus of pleasures" presents many problems including *whose* pleasure and *which* pleasures are valued. Revolt against utilitarianism (and in a sense against enlightment itself) comes from the Romantics.

Woodsworth (1770-1850) and Coleridge (1772-1834) typify English romanticism. Appeal to community, nature, religiion.

John Stuart Mill, prodigy and living prooof of the limits of utilitarianism himself turn to Coleridge to understand his melancholy and depression. Develops philosophy combining utilitarianism and calculation and *organic community* (including religion) and experience. He is the one responsible for the famous idea of freedom as far as not infringing upon other's. 

John Stuart Mill is the background to Darwin.

## Darwin

Genealogy replacing metaphysics. Much has been said about darwin and the Beagle and the origin of the species in 1859. Everyone liked it and seemed to adapt to it (The best book I know on the repercussions of Darwin at the time is the prologue of Back to Methuselah by GBS. Check that).

Biogeography, Paleontology, Embriology, Morphology are the sources of evidence but the key of Darwin/Evolution for the narrative of the modern to the postmodern here is this: humans are taken out of the pedestal 
  - Humans are not the ultimate goal. There is no natural essence of the species, no plan
  - Intelligence is a byproduct of evolution, not a guiding force 

# From struggle to intensity (week 3)

## Boudelaire 

From Dissection (Flaubert) we go to Permeation (Baudelaire). Plunging into the ugly world.

Baudelaire's (step)father focus of hatred. The story from 1848 of "let's kill the general Opique" (is representative of this but also of the poetic sensibility and disdain of Baudelaire. They end up not killing Opique but instead Baudelaire shoots a clock.

In a way Boudelaire oscillates between the Dandy, an aesthetization of the everyday life, and the *Flaneur* a stroller a wanderer sort of bohemian vagabond open to the suggestion of the big city.

In 1851 the Haussmanization of Paris is underway (1853-1870) and this is reflected in Baudelaire's poetry as well. 

Intensity replacing conventionality is perfectly exemplified in Paris Spleen. What at first is arresting grandiosity by the end turns into clash of previously unseen classes connected now by the boulevard.

## Nietzsche

No foundation. No ideal. God is dead.

Nietszche is the anti modern modern as rousseau is the anti-elightnement enlightened.

By 1870 people are happy and nationalistic and Nietzsche is appaled. Cultural decline. How much blood and horror make the good things.

There are not values in themselves. Nietzsche embarks on dissection of morality.

Of course much more is there to say about Nietzsche but for the purpose of the class the point is Nietzsche as the breaking point of the modern, anti foundationalism in bloom. No "really real."

# Paintings

In a rather pleasant coda, the class ends with a small selection of paintings rather than literary authors recaping the transition from the enlightenment to revolution to disillusion to anti-foundationalism.

Delacroix as opposed to Ingres (contrast their napoleons). More Delacroix with the "Death of Sardanapalus," the cultivation of intensity.

Courbet ( a favorite of Baudelaire's) as art for art's sake and eroticism. Le sommeil (the sleepers), L'origin du monde (vagina), and  also the ordinary beauty sublimated for its own sake without royalty,etc. exemplified by the Burial at Ornans

Manet and the famous dejeuner sur l'herbre not just as moral challenge but intellectual game calling attention at the fact that it is a painting.
