@title The Modern and the Postmodern
Notes on Wesleyan course on Modernity and Postmodernity via coursera by Michael S. Roth. Full course available here: [[https://www.coursera.org/learn/modern-postmodern-1 ]]

The course is more or less structured along key figures (not unlike Barzun's dawn to decadence). The following is only a reminder of key ideas, salient points for each.

# What is the enlightment?

## Kant

We start in Sep 30 of 1784 with Kant's "What is enlightment" (http://www.artoftheory.com/what-is-enlightenment_immanuel-kant/). The project of the enlightenment is one of liberation from self-imposed immaturity *through reason*. It is also a process with a dimension of social revolution as the role of the shepperds, particularly religious ones can be dispensed with, once men guided by reason can discern what's right by themselves. *Sapere Aude!* Dare to know is the motto of the enlightenment.

It's important to emphasize that Kant was trying to drive a middle road between the _rationalism_ of Descartes ("I think therefore I am" as assertion of reliance on pure reason as only base) an English _empiricism_ of Locke and Hume who could be summarized as "I feel therefore I am" (sic). They kept skepticism at bay by piling up experience. I the case of Hume the assertion is weaker saying experience builds habit not true knowledge.  


## Rousseau

Kant intensely interested in Rousseau. Rousseau is the bad conscience of the enlightment. He rebels against the optimism of the enlightment itself preferring the idea of the _State of Nature_ and the _Natural man_.

The arts and sciences cover up oppression because they create new needs. What yoke could be imposed on man who need nothing?

The trap of the enlightment is this : elightment → luxury → inequality → yoke

It's not that he doesn't want people to learn. It is pointing out that the project of the enlightment is promoting the key ingredient of the slippery slope of enlightment: inequality.

His solution is mainly to bring the most enlightened to power. That said, in truth his contribution is mostly the diagnosis.

As you acquire luxuries you become more vulnerable to pain. In the society where you act for others and in immitation of higher ones, men suffer for the loss of something they have no pleasure in possesing.

In the discourse of the creation of inequality between mankind he discusses how the state becomes the guarantor of the state of inequality. The rich benefit from getting the poor to defend property.

elightment → luxury → inequality → yoke. Also self-imposed and self-demanded yoke as investment in feelings towards posessions tie us to them
